## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze Company employees during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that time period were six CSV files.

Data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were completed for the analysis.  Specifically, the following steps were completed:
<ul> •	Designed an SQL database </ul>
<ul> •	Created six tables to correspond to the six CSV files </ul>
<ul> •	Imported data from the CSV files </ul>
<ul> •	Completed queries to answer key HR questions </ul>
